You are quite vulnerable to attack at first, but power ups come in the form of a Sega van which you have to dock with. The first time you dock you get double fire, the second time gives you a rocket, the third gives a rear force field and the fourth invulnerablility.  By destroying cars and bikes that appear on your way, you can collect A-F letters. Collecting A through to D allows you change into a sportscar which is less vulnerable to attack, but not as nimble. Collect all the letters in order to be able to transform into a high tech plane. This is the final stage of one of the five missions. Only the high tech plane can guide you to your destination in which your main target is hiding.  There is also time limit in which you have to complete the mission. It is advisable to transform into the high tech plane as fast as it is possible.  Picking up flags gives you bonus points with 10,000 points gaining you an extra life."

	description "Ayrton Senna won the Monaco Grand Prix six times, as well as 3 Formula One world championships, so he was the perfect man to license a home sequel to the classic arcade racing game. As before, the action is viewed from within the cockpit, but depicted using sprites rather than polygons.   There are three main modes:  •Senna GP: Features three non-championship circuits with a preliminary race followed by three laps.   •World Championship: The full 16-race championship. There are two modes in the championship mode that affect how the game is played. Beginner is a regular season, with the same difficulty level as the remaining modes, and cars have roughly the same power. Each race has three laps. In Master things get a twist. There are five groups of cars, and the player starts on the lowly competitive SERGA team. To climb the ranks and get a chance of claim the title the player must challenge a driver from other team and beat him to the top spot. The winner of this particular race gets (or holds) the fastest car. Races are also longer in this mode, and pit-stops are activated, required if the player knocks on too many objects or other cars frequently.   •Free Practice: This allows the player to drive on any race without caring for championship positions. There are two options in Free Practice: Free Run is just the player against the clock and Image Training is a race, but instead of having to quality and then run the three laps, the player can set the number of laps (between one and six), starting position and the condition of the track (dry or wet, only on some circuits)."

This game of quick ducking, jumping and shooting alternates between a side-scrolling and a top-down perspective. •Shooting Gallery: The name says it all. A classic game of aim-and-shoot, spiced up by hidden extras and bonus targets. •Pie Throwing: Meet the Mad Dog gang. They have guns, and you have... cream pies. It's an isometric version of the shooting gallery, only with ammo. And the targets shoot back. •The Train: Basically a side-scrolling beat-em-up on train wagons with some ducking and jumping. Get rid of the mechanics and collect speed logs to push the engine to a magic 88 mph."

When they pull a gun out at you when you open a door, you have only a few seconds to shoot them before they shoot you. If you shoot them too early (ie: before he sticks his gun out at you), it is considered unfair, and you won't score any points, but if you're too late, he'll shoot you and you lose one of your three lives.If you waste too much time, a bandit will come out from one of the doors and stick dynamite on it. You must then shoot the dynamite to get rid of it.   If you're lucky, either a man or a woman will throw you a bag of gold coins. If you shoot any of these people by accident, you also lose a life. More often than not, the person will throw his/her hands up, saying  I haven't got anything . That's when they will be replaced by bandits.   Some men will carry three to five pieces of gold on top of their heads, and shooting at all of the gold will award you with a bag of gold coins. Others will be tied up with rope. If you shoot the rope, there's more money for you, because not only will you receive one bag of gold coins, but you'll get three bags of gold coins."

If the player loses a match then that match can be replayed until won.  The player at the start of each match gets to pick how long the match duration is out of the options of 15, 30, or 45 minutes (not in real time) before being placed on the court. When on the court the player always plays towards the right of the court. First the player tries to get the ball from a throw by a well timed button press. When the player has the ball the player has the option to move, pass the ball, and jump. When jumping the player can shoot, with the accuracy of the shot depending on the timing, or just simply pass. When defending the player can cycle through the field or just simply run into the opponent to challenge for the ball. There are a few penalties that the player can get including but not limited to Travelling (not passing after jumping), Charging (Sometimes called when the player with the ball runs into an opponent), and Pushing (Sometimes called when the player without the ball runs into an opponent) with all the penalties resulting with the other team getting the ball on the side of the court."

	description "Drift back to ancient Phoenicia and challenge yourself with Columns, a game favored by ancient merchants. Forget the passage of time and tickle your mind with this brilliant game of strategy and skill.  The game takes place inside a tall, rectangular playing area. Columns of three different symbols (such as differently-colored jewels) appear, one at a time, at the top of the well and fall to the bottom, landing either on the floor or on top of previously-fallen  Columns  While a column is falling, the player can move it left and right, and can also cycle the positions of the symbols within it. If, after a column has fallen, there are three or more of the same symbols connected in a straight line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, those symbols disappear. The pile of columns then settles under gravity. If this causes three or more other symbols to become aligned, they also disappear and the pile settles again. This process repeats as many times as necessary. It is not uncommon for this to happen three or four times in a row - it often happens by accident when the well is becoming crowded. If the well fills beyond the top of the screen, the game ends. Occasionally, a special column called the Magic Jewel appears. The Magic Jewel flashes with different colors and when it lands, it destroys all the jewels with the same color as the one underneath it. The columns fall at a faster rate as the player progresses. The goal of the game is to play for as long as possible before the well fills up with symbols. Some ports of the game offer alternate game modes as well.  Flash columns  involves mining their way through a set number of lines to get to a flashing jewel at the bottom.  Doubles  allows two players work together in the same well.  Time trial  involves racking up as many points as possible within the time limit."

One day, in the space above Earth, the evil Psy-Crow had cornered a rebel spaceship pilot who had stolen an  Ultra-high-tech-indestructible-super-space-cyber-suit  built by Professor Monkey-for-a-Head. The suit had been commissioned by the evil Queen Pulsating, Bloated, Festering, Sweaty, Pus-filled, Malformed, Slug-for-a-Butt so that she could further conquer the galaxy. In the ensuing space fight, the suit was dropped to Earth, and fell on Jim. By a stroke of luck, Jim managed to land within the collar of the suit, and it ended up mutating him into the large and intelligent (at least by earthworm standards) superhero he is today."

	description "The gameplay is essentially side-scrolling, with horizontal, diagonal and vertical movement. Attacking enemies is accomplished by making Ecco ram into them at high speeds. Swimming could be made progressively faster by tapping a certain button, and the speed could be maintained by holding it down. Players can perform a purely aesthetic spin in the air when jumping out of the water. Two features of the game played on actual dolphin habits; one button causes Ecco to sing, allowing him to speak with other cetaceans and interact with certain objects. The same button is used for echolocation; holding it down would cause the song to return, generating a map of the area. Additionally, Ecco, being a mammal, has to surface periodically for air, or else find an air vent. If the  air meter  ran out, Ecco would lose health rapidly-this represented drowning."

These bios featured short videos of the characters taking their fighting stances and text informing the motives for each character to enter the tournament. The game takes place in a fantasy setting, with most of the game's events occurring on the fictional realms of the Mortal Kombat series. The original game is notably the only title in the series that features only one realm, that being Earthrealm. The tournament featured in the story actually takes place fully at Shang Tsung's Island, located somewhere on Earth, with seven of its locations serving as Kombat Zones."

Once enacted, the dimensional bridge between the two realms connects, allowing Kahn's extermination squads to invade and destroy Earth, and enslave the population's souls.  A small team of Raiden's  Chosen Warriors  survives the attack: Mortal Kombat champion Liu Kang and his ally Kung Lao, Special Forces agents Sonya Blade and Jax, the shaman Nightwolf, the riot cop Stryker, the nomadic Kabal, and former Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero, who has gone rogue from his clan. Facing the warriors are the mercenary Kano, cyber-ninjas Smoke, Sektor and Cyrax, Sheeva, a female Shokan, the sorcerer Shang Tsung, and Queen Sindel herself."

Kahn agrees to this plan, and even restores Tsung's youth. He then extends the invitation to Raiden, who gathers his warriors and takes them into Outworld. The new tournament is much more dangerous, as Shao Kahn has the home field advantage, and an Outworld victory will allow him to subdue Earthrealm."

A single survivor tells Ryu in his last seconds that the Sacred Scroll of Bushido was stolen. With the power of the scroll its owner is mighty enough the gain control of the whole world. Thus Ryu swears to recapture the scroll and the avenge the annihilation of his clan.  The game is sidescrolling platformer/ beat'em up title and incorporates most of the mechanics from the NES games: Ryu can jump and attack with his Dragon Sword. Furthermore, he can collect different kinds of Ninja Magic (which again vary form the powers in the NES games), from shuriken to fire wheels, which can only be used finitely many times, as the use up energy which again must be collected. However, instead of clinging to walls and climbing them, Ryu can push himself off the wall in this game, which must be applied for instance by jumping and forth between two close walls to get higher and higher.  The goal of each level is simply to reach the end of the level before the time runs out. Each level is divided into several sections, and at the end of each level is a boss fight. After beating a boss, a cut scene is shown which continues the story about Ryu's quest for the Bushido scroll and his revenge.  EU release"

Darius II, or Sagaia as it is known in the West, is the second installment in Taito's shoot 'em up series. Its main distinguishing features are the non-linear level system and the enemies, which are different kinds of seafood."

Your only weapon are bullets as your only defense, but if you shoot the flashing red pieces on the terrain, chances are that a green ship will approach you, and if you collect this ship, your weapons will be upgraded so that you shoot a laser beam instead. Keep collecting ships and you can shoot up to three laser beams at once.   At the end of each zone, you will come across a boss that takes multiple hits to kill. If you manage to conquer all three zones, you are back to where you started. The whole point of this game is to earn as many points you can without losing all of your lives."

He also has to collect enough  proof  of the aliens existence (brown coins left behind when they are jumped on), so his family members will help him when he meets a boss (characters such as Nelson and Sideshow Bob). This won't be easy since the Space Mutants are  using  human bodies as disguise. In order to discover who are the real Space Mutants, Bart must use his X-ray Specs.  The ways Bart can get rid of those objects sought by the Space Mutants are numerous. For instance, in the first stage, Bart must get rid of purple objects. He can dye them red, cover them, wash them, etc. Some even involve a little puzzle solving, like playing a trick on Moe to make him get out of the bar."

Aunt Nastácia became ill with a strange sickness that made her sleep for hours on end. Everyone was worried, and it was decided upon that Dr. Caramujo would come examine this odd condition. After the examination, there was good news and bad news. First the good news: there is an antidote for Aunt Nastácia's illness. Now the bad news: in order to create this antidote, 5 ingredients must be combined. Seem easy? Keep reading! The five ingredients are: bat's blood, carapuça of the Saci, the cane of Salsaparrilha of the Curupira, a wire hair of home, and a tear of Cuca. Still sound easy? This isn't everything. You can choose either Pedrinho or Emília as you embark on your quest. Both are equally courageous, and if neither can find all of the 5 ingredients, poor Aunt Nastácia will sleep for 100 years.

Sonic the Hedgehog and Tails fly onto the scene to mount an aerial assault, but Sonic is knocked off the wings of Tails' airplane by a blast from the fortress. He falls into the water, but is rescued and taken to the subterranean levels of the Veg-O-Fortress. The fortress must be destroyed from the inside-out, and the only way to make that happen is to trigger an eruption in the volcano it's built on. Sonic knows this can be done by removing the Chaos Emeralds that keep the volcano stable. Robotnik, however, is also aware of the fragile relationship that exists between the Emeralds and the mountain, and he's set up an elaborate Pinball Defense System to make sure the precious jewels don't go anywhere."

	description "Sonic's Edusoft is an unreleased educational game for the Sega Master System developed in 1991 by Tiertex. The unofficially licensed game had been unknown until a Wikipedia page was created in September 2006.   There are over 15 levels in the game. All of them involve problem solving and for every problem solved your character will move forward eventually reaching the end of the screen and clearing the stage. Your opponent varies depending on the speed setting set at the options screen. For example, if you choose Snail you will race a Moto Bug, but when hare is selected you will race a much faster Rabbit, and the time limit is decreased.  Most of the levels involve find the word puzzles where you have to spell out a word using the available letters. These levels are sometimes interrupted by a match the letters segment, where you must find a certain amount of matching letters among the available letters shown onscreen.
